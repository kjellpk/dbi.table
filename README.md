The purpose of the `dbi.table` package is to query and manipulate
database bjects (e.g.Â tables, views) accessible over a `DBI` using
`data.table`-like syntax.

## Why `dbi.table`?

- concise syntax: fast to type, fast to read - esier than `data.table`
  because there are fewer features
- as fast as the underlying database
- memory efficient - R operations modify queries, not data
- no API lifecycle management
- just me
- feature middle class
