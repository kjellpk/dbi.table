# `dbi.table`

Query and manipulate database objects (e.g., tables, views) accessible
over a `DBI` using `data.table`-like syntax.

## Why `dbi.table`?

- concise syntax: fast to type, fast to read - in fact, even easier than
  `data.table` because there arenâ€™t as many features
- as fast as the underlying database
- memory efficient - R operations modify queries, not data
- no API lifecycle management
- just me
- includes features
