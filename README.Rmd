# `dbi.table`

Query and manipulate database objects (e.g., tables, views) accessible over a
`DBI` connection using `data.table`-like syntax. 

## Why `dbi.table`?

* concise syntax: fast to type, fast to read - in fact, even easier than
  `data.table` because there aren't as many features
* as fast as the underlying database
* memory efficient - R operations modify queries, not data
* no API lifecycle management
* just me
* includes features
